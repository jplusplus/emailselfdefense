							Bulk surveillance violates our fundamental rights and makes free speech risky. This guide will teach you a basic surveillance self-defense skill: email encryption. Once you've finished, you'll be able to send and receive emails that are coded to make sure that a surveillance agent or thief can't intercept your email and read it.</p>

<p>Even if you have nothing to hide, using encryption helps protect the privacy of people you communicate with, and makes life difficult for bulk surveillance systems. If you do have something important to hide, you're in good company; these are the same tools that Edward Snowden used to share his famous secrets about the NSA.</p>

					<!--<p>You'll also be able to sign emails to show reliably that they are from you. Though the need for signing may be less obvious, you'll actually do it more often.</p>-->

					<p class="notes">This guide relies on software which is freely licensed; it's completely transparent and anyone can copy it or make their own version. This makes it safer from surveillance than proprietary software (like Windows). To be as safe as possible from surveillance, we recommend you switch to a free software operating system like GNU/Linux. Learn more about free software at <a href="https://u.fsf.org/ys">fsf.org</a>.</p>

					<h2><em>#2</em> Make your keys</h2>
						<p>To use the GnuPG system, you'll need a public key and a private key (known together as a keypair). Each is a long string of randomly generated numbers that are unique to you. Your public and private keys are linked together by a special mathematical function.</p>

<p>Your public key isn't like a physical key, because it's stored in the open in an online directory called a keyserver. People download it and use it, along with GnuPG, to encrypt emails they send to you. You can think of the keyserver as phonebook, where people who want to send you an encrypted email look up your public key.</p>

<p>Your private key is more like a physical key, because you keep it to yourself (on your computer). You use GnuPG and your private key to decode encrypted emails other people send to you.</p>

						<h3><em>Step 2.a</em> Make a keypair</h3>
						<p>In your email program's menu, select OpenPGP &rarr; Setup Wizard. You don't need to read the text in the window that pops up unless you'd like to, but it's good to read the text on the later screens of the wizard.</p>
						<p>On the second screen, titled "Signing," select "No, I want to create per-recipient rules for emails that need to be signed."</p>
						<p>Use the default options until you reach the screen titled "Create Key".</p>
						<p>On the screen titled "Create Key," pick a strong password! Your password should be at least 12 characters and include at least one lower case and upper case letter and at least one number or punctuation symbol. Don't forget the password, or all this work will be wasted!</p>
		  			<p class="notes">The program will take a little while to finish the next step, the "Key Creation" screen. While you wait, do something else with your computer, like watching a movie or browsing the Web. The more you use the computer at this point, the faster the key creation will go.</p>
						<p>When the OpenPGP Confirm screen pops up, select Generate Certificate and choose to save it in a safe place on your computer (we recommend making a folder called "Revocation Certificate" in your home folder and keeping it there. You'll learn more about the revocation certificate in <a href="#section5">Section 5</a>. The setup wizard will ask you to move it onto an external device, but that isn't necessary at this moment.</p>
						<p class="notes">After creating your key, the Enigmail set-up wizard automatically uploaded it to a keyserver, an online computer that makes everyone's keys available through the Internet.</p>

				<div class="section-intro">
						<h2><em>#4</em> Learn the Web of Trust</h2>
						<p>Email encryption is a powerful technology, but it has a weakness; it requires a way to verify that a person's public key is actually theirs. Otherwise, there would be no way to stop an attacker from making an email address with your friend's name, creating keys to go with it and impersonating your friend.</p>

						<p>That's why the programmers that developed email encryption created keysigning and the Web of Trust. When you sign someone's key, you are publicly saying that you trust that it does belong to them and not an impostor.</p>

<p>People who use your public key can see the number of signatures it has. Once you've used GnuPG for a long time, you may have hundreds of signatures. The Web of Trust is the constellation of GnuPG users, connected to each other by chains of trust expressed through signatures, into a giant Web. The more signatures a key has, and the more signatures its signers' keys have, the more trustworthy that key is.</p>

<p>People's public keys are usually identified by their key ID, which is a short string of digits like 9G6E29F7. You may also see them referred to by their key fingerprint, which is a slightly longer string of digits often prefaced with 0x, like 0x2C1008316F3E89B7.</p>

						<h3>When should I encrypt?</h3>

						<p>The more you can encrypt your messages, the better. This is because, if you only encrypt emails occasionally, each encrypted message could raise a red flag for surveillance systems. If all or most of your email is encrypted, people doing surveillance won't know where to start.</p>

<p>That's not to say that only encrypting some of your email isn't helpful -- it's a great start and it makes bulk surveillance more difficult.</p>

Add it to your email signature, so that anyone corresponding with you knows that they can donwload your public key and verify that it's the correct one. It's also good to post it on your media profile, blog, Website, or business card. (At the Free Software Foundation, we put ours on our <a href="https://fsf.org/about/staff">staff page</a>.)</p><p>We need to get our culture to the point that we feel like something is missing when we see an email address without a public key ID.</p>

						<h3>Go to a keysigning party</h3>
						<p>Keysigning parties are social events designed to build the Web of Trust. Participants match each others' photo IDs and key IDs, and then get out their laptops and sign each other's public keys. They're a great way to meet likeminded people and learn about new privacy tools, as well as build up people's trust in your key. Look for keysignings at tech events, hackerspaces and nerdy parties.</p>

                        <p>Mac OS is a nonfree operating system, which means that no one but Apple gets to see the code it runs on. This makes running Mac OS risky for your privacy -- there's no way to know if it's spying on you.</p><p>To push back hard against surveillance, we recommend you switch to a free software operating system like GNU/Linux. Free operating systems are completely transparent, so anyone can find and remove dangerous code. Learn more about free software at <a href="https://u.fsf.org/ys">fsf.org</a>.</p>
